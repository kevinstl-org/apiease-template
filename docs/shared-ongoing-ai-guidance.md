# Shared Ongoing AI Guidance

Use this file for shared implementation lessons that should apply across APIEase projects.

Add concise, reusable guidance here when real-world implementation work reveals behavior that agents should not re-learn project by project.

## APIEase Resource Identifier Guidance

Use these directives when creating or reviewing repository-managed APIEase resources, examples, Liquid, CLI commands, and docs.

- Treat requests, widgets, variables, and functions as first-class APIEase resources with a server-owned immutable `id`, a merchant-controlled `handle`, and a human-readable `name`.
- Prefer `handle` as the stable public identifier for resources. Do not store server-owned `id` values in template resource source files or examples. Use `name` only as display text.
- For resource source files, `handle` is the stable repository identifier. Handles should be lowercase slugs using letters, numbers, and hyphens, for example `product-details-proxy`.
- For CLI read, update, and delete flows, prefer the resource-specific handle flags: `--request-handle`, `--widget-handle`, `--variable-handle`, and `--function-handle`. Legacy flags such as `--request-id`, `--widget-id`, `--variable-name`, and `--function-id` remain compatibility aliases; pass handles through them only when maintaining older scripts.
- When a request, widget, variable, or function source file has a valid `handle`, `apiease create <resource> --file <path>` is idempotent: it creates the resource when the handle does not exist and updates the existing resource when it does. Lookup failures other than not found stop the command instead of falling back to create.
- For older request source files that still contain `id` metadata or no `handle`, use `apiease create request --file <path> --auto-update-source-identifier` to migrate only the local identifier metadata.
- APIEase request invocation surfaces may still use the parameter name `requestId`. In Liquid `call` tags, storefront calls, remote calls, and Flow conditions, provide or compare the request handle as the `requestId` value whenever possible.
- For chained request references, prefer the request handle when the APIEase surface supports it. Use names only as compatibility fallback display identifiers.

## APIEase Liquid Runtime Constraints

Use these directives when generating or reviewing Liquid for APIEase.

These directives come from real runtime failures observed during client validation. Treat them as stricter-than-standard Liquid constraints for APIEase.

## Required Directives

- Do not place filtered expressions directly in `if` conditions in APIEase Liquid. Compute filtered values with `assign` first, then compare plain variables.
- Do not assume nested response properties are null-safe in APIEase Liquid. Check key presence before dereferencing paths like `response.data.errors` or `result.userErrors`.

## Known Failure Modes

### 1. Filters Inside `if` Conditions Can Fail To Parse

Observed error:

```text
Error during liquid call dispatch: expected ":" after filter name, line:55, col:51
```

Problem pattern:

```liquid
{% if header_columns[0] | remove: '"' | strip != 'EXPECTED_PRODUCT_CODE' %}
```

Safe pattern:

```liquid
{% assign first_header = header_columns[0] | remove: '"' | strip %}
{% if first_header != 'EXPECTED_PRODUCT_CODE' %}
```

### 2. Nested Property Access Is Not Null-Safe

Observed error:

```text
Error during liquid call dispatch: undefined variable: batch_response.data.errors, line:253, col:21
```

Problem pattern:

```liquid
{% assign errors = batch_response.data.errors %}
{% assign user_errors = mutation_result.userErrors %}
```

Safe pattern:

```liquid
{% assign batch_response_json = batch_response | json %}
{% if batch_response_json contains '"errors"' %}
  {% assign errors = batch_response.data.errors %}
{% endif %}
```

Apply the same pattern to any nested path. Confirm the parent payload contains the key before dereferencing the nested property.
